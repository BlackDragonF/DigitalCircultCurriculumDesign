# DigitalCircultCurriculumDesign

## Introduction
This is the curriculum design for Digital Circult in the Department of Computer Science and Technology in Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

And the author is an undergraduate majored in Computer Science, HUST.

The curriculum design aims at using vivado to design a controller for a automatic vending machine. For detailed problem description/report, please contact me directly.

## Cheating
If you're with the similar curriculum design, it's all fine to refer to my solution.

And limited with my low understanding of verilog/hardware design, it's greatly welcomed that you point out my fault or open issues or make pull requests.

But copying my code directly or cheating is unbearable.
